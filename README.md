#Akka patterns

This repository contains code that demonstrates large-scale Akka applications. My aim is to share my experience & the pains so that you don't have to re-invent the wheel yourself.

Check out the API in the application at [Akka Patterns API](http://docs.akkapatterns.apiary.io/).

Follow me on Twitter [@honzam399](https://twitter.com/honzam399); submit your requests for the next topic to cover by adding an issue [Issues](https://github.com/eigengo/akka-patterns/issues).

The topics I shall cover include:

* [Building (Maven and SBT)](../../../akka-patterns/wiki/Building)
* [Composing features](../../../akka-patterns/wiki/Composing)
* [Configuration](../../../akka-patterns/wiki/Configuration)
* Testing (unit, integration and white-box), including BDD
* Data access (relational, document, key-value and graph databases)
* Transactional behaviour
* Proper application of purely functional code & patterns (Shapeless and Scalaz)
* Authentication and authorisation
* [User interface](../../../akka-patterns/wiki/UserInterface)
* [Comparison with Spring Framework](../../../akka-patterns/wiki/Spring)
* Data access--the "old school" in Scala 2.9.2 and the slick new one in 2.10 in #Slick

See the [Wiki](../../../akka-patterns/wiki/Home) for documentation of the various patterns; and please do share your ideas!
