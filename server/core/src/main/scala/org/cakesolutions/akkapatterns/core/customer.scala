/**
 * An alternative to using Actors (see UserActor) is to have traditional controllers.
 *
 * The advantage is clear: much simpler code that remains typesafe vs akka.ask.
 *
 * The disadvantage is that controllers cannot be distributed as easily as actors.
 * However, it is possible to refactor the internals of a controller to use an
 * Actor implementation if that is needed. And fire and forget tasks that are done as
 * part of a controller are most certainly prime candidates as Actor actions.
